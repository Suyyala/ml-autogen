This code will create a new ACI deployment configuration, then create a new ACI service using the specified GPT-3 model. The code will then wait for the deployment to complete, and finally return the scoring endpoint for the deployed service. You can use this endpoint to make requests to the GPT-3 model via the ACI service.
